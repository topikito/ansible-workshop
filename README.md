# Ansible workshop

This workshop is intended to work as an introduction to Ansible. By the use of a few exercises, we will get an idea of
how this provisioner works and hopefully will be able to setup our own scripts for provisioning our own machines.

## Tasks

The workshop is divided in tasks that has their own instructions (`README.md`) with a particular problem to solve. There
 will be provided a solution for each task so you can check how I managed to solve the proposed problem.
